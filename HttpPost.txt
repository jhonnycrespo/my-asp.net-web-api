HttpPost
=========

Is an optional attribute.

The [HttpPost] attribute tells the routing engine to send any POST requests to that action method to the one method over the other. This is a type of overloading.

The default for a method is [HttpGet]. Because of that, no attribute is needed.

Example:

[HttpGet]
public ActionResult Edit(int id) { ... }

[HttpPost]
public ActionResult Edit(MyEditViewModel myEditViewModel) { ... }
